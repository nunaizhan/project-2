    <strong>My hobby is reading books.</strong>

    <details>
       <summary>How does it make me feel?</summary>
       <p>Like I can breath again and like I'm not lost. Reading a good book is like falling in love. Unpredictable. Exhilarating. Scary. Sad. Real. Wonderful. The world has color and life you never saw until you read. You see words on a page that magically transform into worlds and people and voices and conflict. You step into imagination and forget that anything exists outside of it and the book in your hand. Reading makes me feel understood and makes me understand. No matter what occurs, I know books will comfort and tell me that I am never truly alone. I am a happy book addict for those reason.</p>
